        "Kakashi Hatake („ÅØ„Åü„Åë„Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan (ÂÜôËº™Áúº„ÅÆ„Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, Sharingan no Kakashi) and the Copy Ninja („Ç≥„Éî„ÉºÂøçËÄÖ, Kopƒ´ Ninja), he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage (ÂÖ≠‰ª£ÁõÆÁÅ´ÂΩ±, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow).",
        "Kakashi finds his father dead.",
        "Because his mother died when he was very young,14 Kakashi was raised during his early years by his father, Sakumo. Sakumo was famed throughout the shinobi world, having saved Konoha on at least one occasion; Kakashi in particular revered his father.",
        "Kakashi becomes a genin.",
        "In the Academy, Kakashi earned top grades, earning him recognition as a prodigy and the best of his generation.154 Ultimately, he became very popular amongst his peers. With his talents soon being recognised, at age 5, Kakashi graduated from the Academy at the top of his class in a single year. When his classmates, Rin Nohara and Obito graduated four years later, they were teamed together, with Kakashi, under the leadership of Minato Namikaze. In the anime, Minato gave the team a bell test at its formation, assigning the three to take the two bells he kept on his person. Minato often held back less against the prodigious Kakashi than with Rin and Obito so they couldn't obtain the bells without teamwork. Unfortunately, Kakashi realised this, only using Obito and Rin as a means to an end to obtain the bells. Nonetheless, Minato passed them because they accomplished the goal of the test by working as a team. Minato did encourage them to improve their teamwork afterwards, a message that Obito and Rin took to heart, but fell upon deaf ears with Kakashi.16 Team Minato would go on many missions during its career, but Kakashi's devotion to the rules often made him difficult to work with;17 Obito, already jealous of Kakashi's natural talent and popularity, was frequently at odds with him about this behaviour. At age 6, Konoha officials allowed Kakashi to compete in the Ch≈´nin Exams with his team, which he passed by defeating Might Guy and became a ch≈´nin.18",
        "During one of Sakumo's missions - after Kakashi was promoted to ch≈´nin -19 Sakumo made the decision to save the lives of his teammates rather than complete the assignment. The mission's failure had disastrous consequences for the Land of Fire, causing many in Konoha, including the teammates he saved, to vilify him for abandoning his duties. Disgraced, Sakumo committed suicide. Seeing what his father went through and determined not to make the same mistakes, Kakashi decided that following the Shinobi Rules must always take priority.20",
        "Konoha eventually became embroiled in the Third Shinobi World War. As part of the war effort, Team Minato was assigned to destroy the Kannabi Bridge in Kusagakure in order to cut off Iwagakure's supply line. Minato was needed on the front lines at the time, leaving Kakashi, recently promoted to j≈çnin at age 12,21 in charge. Before embarking on the mission, Minato and Rin gave him presents to celebrate his promotion; Obito forgot to get him anything. Shortly after entering Kusa, they encountered an Iwa-scout, Mahiru. Kakashi tried to eliminate him with his new jutsu, Chidori, but the attack speed left him vulnerable to counter-attack, forcing Minato to step in, save Kakashi, and kill Mahiru himself. Before leaving them, Minato advised Kakashi to not use the Chidori again.",
        "Kakashi saving Obito.",
        "Kakashi, Rin, and Obito continued further in to Kusa. They were eventually found by Mahiru's teammates, Kakk≈ç and Taiseki, who kidnapped Rin in order to find out what their mission was. Obito immediately suggested that they rescue her, but Kakashi elected to abandon Rin, believing it was more important to finish the mission before concerning themselves with her safety. Obito refused to go along with this and went off to save Rin by himself. Before he left, he told Kakashi that Sakumo had been a hero and that, although it was bad to abandon one's mission, it was worse to abandon one's teammates. Kakashi began carrying out the mission alone, but ultimately decided that Obito was right and went to join him. He arrived in time to save Obito from Taiseki with his White Light Chakra Sabre, which he inherited from his father.",
        "Taiseki turned invisible and tried launching a sneak attack on Obito. Kakashi protected him, but his left eye was badly damaged in the process. In that moment, Obito awakened his Sharingan and used it to kill Taiseki. They then entered the cave where Rin was being held, drove off Kakk≈ç, and released Rin from the genjutsu he placed her under. Kakk≈ç retaliated by forcing a cave-in and Kakashi, due to his damaged eye, was struck in his blind spot and had difficulty avoiding the falling rocks. Before he could be crushed by a large boulder, Obito pushed him out of the way, becoming trapped instead. Unable to get free and knowing his injuries were too serious to survive, Obito decided to make his last act giving Kakashi the present he forgot to give him earlier: his Sharingan to replace the eye Kakashi lost.",
        "After Rin transplanted Obito's Sharingan into him, Kakashi confronted Kakk≈ç. His White Light Chakra Sabre was destroyed during the ensuing fight, but he succeeded in killing Kakk≈ç with Chidori; due to the Sharingan's heightened vision, Kakashi was finally able to handle its speed. He went back to where Obito and Rin were, but Iwa reinforcements soon arrived and started constricting the rubble. Obito asked Kakashi to take Rin away and keep her safe, which Kakashi did, leaving Obito behind. As the Iwa-nin started surrounding them, Kakashi attacked them for as long as he could, holding them off until Minato eventually tracked them down and finished off the rest. Minato assisted them with destroying the Kannabi Bridge and then returned with them to Konoha to mourn Obito's death. Despite many from the Uchiha clan being against Kakashi wielding a Sharingan as he had no blood-ties to them, Fugaku Uchiha, the Uchiha head, chose to honour Obito's dying actions and let Kakashi keep his gift.22",
        "Kakashi unintentionally kills Rin.",
        "During a later mission, Rin was kidnapped by Kirigakure. Kakashi was eventually able to rescue her and started taking her back to Konoha. Along the way, Rin revealed that Kiri had sealed the Three-Tails into her body with the intention to, once she inevitably lost control of it, have it unleashed on Konoha and destroy the village from within. In order to prevent this from happening, Rin begged Kakashi to kill her, but he refused, unwilling to break his promise to Obito to protect her and hoping to find some other solution. When Kiri-nin caught up with them and made false efforts to retrieve her, Kakashi fought them off with his renamed Chidori, the Lightning Cutter. During one of these attacks, Rin jumped in front of Kakashi's attack, dying by his hand so that Konoha would be safe.23 The trauma of this caused his Sharingan to evolve into a Mangeky≈ç Sharingan shortly before Kakashi passed out.24 He was later found by Konoha reinforcements, but none could explain the slaughter of all the Kiri forces, not knowing of Tobi's actions.25",
        "Kakashi joins the Anbu.",
        "Because he'd lost two teammates in such a short timespan, his role in Rin's death, and his failure to honour Obito's last request by protecting her, Kakashi dropped into a depression. In the anime, many believed he purposely killed Rin to prevent her from leaking information, earning him the nickname \"Friend-Killer Kakashi\". Many, especially those in Anbu believed he would kill a comrade without hesitation if it was for the sake of completing the mission. He would also spend his days avoiding friends and former classmates and at night he would be haunted by dreams of himself killing Rin again. Minato, now the new Hokage, tried to help Kakashi emerge from the darkness he'd fallen into after Obito and Rin's deaths by assigning him to the Anbu in order to have him close in an attempt to alleviate his pain.26 Kakashi did well in the Anbu, eventually becoming a captain and the leader of Team Ro. However, his successes were owed to his cold behaviour and his ruthlessness in combat, signs that he was still upset by Rin's death. Minato therefore tried a different tactic: assigning Kakashi to protect Minato's wife, Kushina Uzumaki, during her pregnancy. Kakashi carried out his duties faithfully, monitoring Kushina from the shadows whenever she left her home.27 During his time off, he would visit Rin's grave and Obito's engraving to tell them his regrets and how life was going without them.28",
        "Kakashi and his peers are blocked from helping Konoha.",
        "During the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack, Kakashi and many of Konoha's other young ninja were prevented from helping defend the village, instead being confined within a barrier to keep them safe.29 Minato eventually saved the village from the Nine-Tails, but at the cost of his and Kushina's lives. After which, Danz≈ç Shimura approached a grieving young Kakashi, noting that it was Hiruzen Sarutobi's orders for the children, even high-ranking ninja like Kakashi, to not help battle the Nine-Tails, ultimately preventing Kakashi from possibly saving Minato and Kushina. Convincing an emotional Kakashi that the Third was not best for the future of the village, Kakashi agreed to join Danz≈ç's Root division and spy on the Hokage for him. During a mission, Kakashi encountered another Root member codenamed \"Kinoe\" who was able to use Wood Release.27 Knowing that Wood Release was unique to the First Hokage, Kakashi broke in to the Hokage Residence to see what he could learn about this anomaly. The Third caught him, but freely gave him the information he wanted: Konoha had tried to recreate the Wood Release powers in the past, but abandoned the project for killing too many test subjects. The Third then mused that the Nine-Tails might have been defeated and Minato saved had the research been successful.",
        "Kakashi spares Kinoe's life.",
        "From this meeting with the Third, it became clear to Kakashi that the Third was not the ineffectual, passionless leader Danz≈ç had made him out to be. Moreover, Danz≈ç had not used Kinoe to try and stop the Nine-Tails' attack. Realising he had picked the wrong side, Kakashi told the Third about Danz≈ç's plans to assassinate him and, the following day, personally lured out the assassins, of whom Kinoe was one. Kakashi easily defeated him, but chose to spare his life in the belief that he would become a valuable ally in the future. Kakashi attempted to resign from the Anbu afterwards for working against the Hokage, but the Third insisted his service was invaluable and made Kakashi his right-hand man.30",
        "Kakashi unable to stop Orochimaru.",
        "From investigating a series of disappearances, Kakashi provided a lead and it was discovered that Orochimaru was behind the Wood Release research that produced Kinoe. In the anime, Kakashi attacked Orochimaru when the Third Hokage failed to apprehend him, but he was paralysed by Orochimaru's killing intent and Orochimaru escaped.31 Kakashi followed him once he regained his composure, but was captured by the Iburi clan, who were loyal to Orochimaru. Kinoe, their ally, convinced them to let him interrogate Kakashi. Once alone, Kinoe confided that Danz≈ç was making his own plans against Orochimaru and, with help from Yukimi, helped Kakashi get free.32 Kakashi later planned to use Yukimi to capture Orochimaru, since she was of great importance to him. Later, Kakashi explained that Yukimi's blood could temporarily bestow Orochimaru with the Iburi clan's smoke transformation, allowing him to slip across the border. Overhearing that, Yukimi slipped away and returned to the cave. Orochimaru ultimately killed most of the Iburi clan before escaping yet again, but Kakashi, recognising that Kinoe's relationship with Yukimi is much like his relationship with Rin was, helped keep her safe. Kakashi decided to leave and not report anything about the Iburi or Root's involvement.33",
        "Kakashi and Kinoe surrounded by Root.",
        "Kakashi continued to investigate Orochimaru over the following years, eventually locating one of his secret labs three years after the latter's defection. While there, he was attacked by Kinoe, who Danz≈ç had sent to take his Sharingan. Kakashi tried to reason with him by stating that friendship should take higher priority than the mission. When Kinoe accused Kakashi of violating that creed by killing Rin, enraged by that comment, Kakashi overpowered him and decided to bring him before the Third Hokage.34 Before they could leave, one of Orochimaru's snake experiments escaped its test tube and attacked the duo. As Kinoe was taken captive, Kakashi managed to slay the creature. While saving Kinoe, the creature's corpse began emitting a poisonous vapour which quickly infected Kakashi. Kinoe got Kakashi out safely and, having accepted Kakashi's words, gave Kakashi an antidote and chose to abandon his mission whilst leaving Kakashi a message about it. When Kakashi woke up, he knew Danz≈ç would punish Kinoe for insubordination and asked the Third for help. With the Third's permission, Kakashi forced his way into Root headquarters and stopped Danz≈ç from applying a cursed seal to Kinoe. As Root forces started to surround them, the Third showed up to personally authorise Kakashi's actions, and further negotiated Kinoe's release from Root. Kakashi added Kinoe, now with the new codename \"Tenz≈ç\", to Team Ro.35",
        "Kakashi and Itachi mercilessly assassinate the Praj√±ƒÅ Group.",
        "Two years later, Itachi Uchiha was added to Team Ro. Kakashi and Itachi were at one point assigned to observe a meeting between Konoha and the Land of Woods. When the Land of Woods' Praj√±ƒÅ Group tried to betray the Konoha forces, Kakashi and Itachi moved in and defeated them. Although Kakashi was impressed by Itachi's abilities, he warned him against his merciless approach and encouraged him on the importance of friends.36 Sometime later, Itachi asked Kakashi if dead friends' requests should be honoured, which Kakashi said they should.37 Itachi was eventually promoted out of Team Ro and replaced by Y≈´gao Uzuki. Shortly afterwards, Team Ro was sent to the Uchiha clan's compound with orders to pacify a brewing rebellion, only to find the entire clan dead. When news emerged that Itachi was responsible and that he had killed his best friend, Shisui Uchiha, in pursuit of power, Kakashi lamented his failure to have had a better influence on Itachi.",
        "Kakashi leaves the Anbu.",
        "Because of what happened with Itachi, the Third Hokage felt that individuals with kind hearts did not belong in the Anbu. He therefore thanked Kakashi for his years of service and relieved him of his duty, returning him to the standard forces.38 Over the years, he was placed in charge of several teams of Academy graduates, but none ever demonstrated the teamwork he considered to be so important. In the anime, he started worrying that his own methods were too harsh, but from seeing how his former underlings that he previously failed prospered due to his teachings, his faith was reaffirmed.16",
        "Kakashi's cold-heartedness.",
        "Kakashi has been very independent, perceptive, and self-confident since early childhood, and tends to broach difficult conversations with blunt pragmatism. He carries himself with a relaxed, almost bored disposition and is known for being solitary and aloof, with an occasional tendency to ignore his peers. These qualities lead some to perceive him as arrogant or condescending; however, Kakashi is truthfully quite modest about himself, even in the face of his growing reputation as a ninja and leader. He is also habitually tardy, showing up at his leisure with excuses that convince nobody, and later leaving for equally poor reasons. Though Kakashi wants others to believe this is how he always acts, he only does so for matters that aren't of particular importance. In his role as Hokage, Kakashi dutifully worked for the village's progress. He also believes that even in times of peace, no one should become a ninja without appreciating the importance of it.",
        "Kakashi suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Kakashi's life was shaped by the death of his childhood squadmates. He spends hours of his free time visiting Rin's grave and the Memorial Stone where Obito's name is engraved, telling them about his life, recent events in Konoha, and others they knew. Most of all, he shares his regrets that they cannot be with him and that their deaths were his fault. In the anime, after Rin died, Kakashi struggled to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, having nightmares about her death and growing depressed whenever others mentioned her. Over time, Kakashi comes to accept that her choice to sacrifice herself and his guilt became more about his broken promise to Obito to keep her safe. This causes Obito's apparent death to weigh more heavily on him, compounded by regrets about his behaviour when they last spoke. Kakashi feels that, had he cared about teamwork and friendship in the same way that Obito did, Obito's \"death\" might have been avoided. Thinking it would ease his pain, Minato convinced Kakashi to join the Anbu. During his time in the Anbu however, Kakashi gained a reputation for his cold-bloodedness. Kurenai Y≈´hi noted that Kakashi suffered with suicidal thoughts during his Anbu career, with his reckless fighting style and lack of self-care being deemed as Kakashi being in a hurry to die.39",
        "After his father's death, Kakashi initially became stern and cold toward others, chastising any who disobeyed orders and being willing to abandon his comrades to finish missions. However, Obito's apparent death profoundly changed him; he became committed to teamwork and always places teammates' well-being above the mission's. He believes goals can be accomplished more effectively together, asking for help when he needs it, providing help when it is requested of him, and praising allies when they deserve it. An abuse of one's teammates is the only thing that can make Kakashi cast aside his normally stoic demeanour, causing him to attack without mercy or his usual sense of sportsmanship. He expects his prospective students to demonstrate this same devotion to teamwork, which none until Team 7 were able to do; despite the high failure rate, the Third Hokage agrees with Kakashi's choice to require it. Kakashi becomes fond of all Team 7's members, even Sasuke Uchiha, to the point of blaming himself for Sasuke's criminal acts and his team's growing rift over it throughout Part II. He holds out hope that Sasuke will correct his behaviour, and for his patience he is able to see Team 7 reunified when by the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War.",
        'Kakashi and Guy competing in their usual "contests".',
        "Might Guy has considered Kakashi his rival ever since they first met in the Academy. Despite his father's warning that Guy might someday prove stronger than him, Kakashi didn't think much of Guy at the time. Guy took this as a challenge and began striving to earn Kakashi's approval so as to show that his perseverance could be just as good as Kakashi's natural genius. When Guy would suggest contests to test how their abilities compared, Kakashi would respond with indifference, only fuelling Guy's desire to defeat his \"cool, hip, and trendy\" personality. At the start of Part I, Kakashi's score is 50 wins and 49 losses,40 though even when Guy takes the lead the score difference remains the same; considering that their competitions range from eating contests to Rock, Paper, Scissors, the score isn't truly representative of anything. Kakashi eventually comes to consider Guy one of his closest and most reliable friends, and by the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, he acknowledges that Guy has surpassed him.",
        "Kakashi's obsession with the Icha Icha series.",
        "When he first meets his students on Team 7, Kakashi claims to have many hobbies, none of which he chooses to share at the time. He is an avid fan of the Icha Icha series of novels; he always has one of the books with him and regularly reads it, even while talking to others. Naruto Uzumaki identifies Icha Icha as one of Kakashi's few weaknesses, which he is able to take advantage of during a bell test by threatening to spoil the ending of the newest book in the series, forcing Kakashi to shut his eyes and ears and thereby leave himself vulnerable. Although most people he knows are aware of how much he likes Icha Icha, Kakashi is seemingly uncomfortable sharing the books with others, embarrassed by the presumably adult content.",
        "Following his retirement from active duty, Kakashi has become much more laid-back and unbothered by events and people surrounding him. His speech mannerisms and tone also resemble those of an old man. Although steadfast during any and all important events, Kakashi actively avoids taking on responsibilities during his free time, such as when he attempted to evade Boruto's pleas for training. Furthermore, Kakashi also enjoys having others perform the most basic of chores on his behalf, such as roping Boruto into helping him with shopping duties, and initially refusing to help with Sabure and Yubeshi's issues with their respective grandparents until being promised a rare first edition of an Icha Icha volume, with an extended ending.",
        "Kakashi without his mask.",
        "Kakashi has a strong resemblance to his father, so much so that they are sometimes mistaken for each other.41 He has spiky silver hair often oriented to his left-side, dark grey eyes (black in several instances), and typically a relaxed and lazy expression. During the Third Shinobi World War, his left eye was damaged, leaving a vertical scar from the injury. The eye was shortly afterwards replaced with a Sharingan, which he covers with his forehead protector when he isn't using it. After his original eye was restored by Naruto during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi returned to wearing his forehead protector balanced above his forehead. Since early childhood and near-constantly, he wears a mask that prevents most of his face from being visible. Even his ninken have seen his face so sparingly that most of them don't remember what he looks like unmasked.42 On the few occasions he exposes his full face, he has a narrow jaw-line and a beauty mark under the left corner of his mouth.43 Overall, he is considered very handsome as seen from Teuchi and Ayame's reaction to seeing his face.44",
        "Kakashi wears Konoha's standard infantry clothing for most of Part I and Part II: a flak jacket, dark blue pants, and a long-sleeve shirt. He also wears fingerless gloves with metal plates on the backhand and is seen with a chain necklace underneath.45 His appearance remains largely the same following the Fourth Shinobi World War, except for a red armband on his left bicep, boots instead of sandals, and Konoha's redesigned flak jacket. The kanji \"ÂÖ≠ÁÅ´\" (Literally meaning Six Fire) is written on the back, denoting his Hokage position. For formal occasions, he wears the typical Hokage garb: the traditional headpiece and haori, along with a red, full-length kimono, tied using a white sash. Written vertically on the back of the robe, Kakashi has the kanji for Sixth Hokage (ÂÖ≠‰ª£ÁõÆÁÅ´ÂΩ±, Rokudaime Hokage, literally meaning: Sixth Fire Shadow). He switched from using a knotted forehead protector to a modern elasticised one.",
        "Kakashi wore several different outfits prior to Part I. In the academy, he wore a long sleeved anchor-grey shirt with a zipper, a green scarf and slate-coloured shorts. He also wore blue sandals, which he also wore during the Third Shinobi World War. During the Third Shinobi World War, he wore a black T-shirt with white stripes in the middle of the sleeves, additional sleeves over his arms, metal arm protectors, leather straps around his back and chest, and dark pants. Prior to its destruction, his family's White Light Chakra Sabre was kept in a small holder in the middle of his back. During his Anbu career, he wore a simple blue suit with a grey flak jacket, strapped up sandals and arm guards that went up to his elbows. While not on duty as an Anbu, he wore a similar outfit with segmented gauntlets and bandages over his calves. His fox mask46 had red and black markings around the eyes, sides, and mouth. One trait left over from his career as an Anbu is their signature tattoo resembling a red flame on his left deltoid.",
        'Kakashi disguised as "Sukea".',
        'When masquerading as "Sukea", he removes his forehead protector and mask. Instead, he wears a wig of shaggy greyish-brown hair, grey-coloured contact lenses, along with purple makeup over his eyes and purple patches under them to conceal his scar. He also normally wears a long green trench coat and purple scarf with grey pants. While playing along into pretending to steal his own ninja registration photo, Kakashi briefly wore a black long-sleeved shirt and a light grey flak jacket.',
        "Kakashi intimidating opponents with his jutsu.",
        "Kakashi is one of the strongest ninja Konoha ever produced. A prodigy of such innate talent and intellect,47 he showcased highly advanced skill from a young age.48 From which, he rapidly rose through the ninja ranks.49 His prowess is said to rival an entire country50 and earned recognition on sight by various high-level ninja.51 The S-Rank members of Akatsuki acknowledge his might;52 he outmanoeuvred Itachi Uchiha (albeit he couldn't use his Mangeky≈ç Sharingan at the time), fought Kisame Hoshigaki and Kakuzu to a standstill, and was deemed a major threat by Pain.53 Against Koji Kashin, one of Kara's strongest Inners, Kakashi was able to pressure the foe into retreating.54",
        "In general, Kakashi is very versatile with advanced proficiency in countless areas including mastery of all three main ninja skills; noted as smarter than Shikamaru Nara, better sense of smell than Kiba Inuzuka, more adept with the Sharingan than Sasuke Uchiha, and better taijutsu skill than Rock Lee, each of whom are well-known for their high capacities in their respective areas.55 Kakashi's genjutsu prowess is able to use basic techniques to major effect for intimidation and distraction.56 Kakashi's combat and tactical prowess are so revered, that many foresaw his rise to Hokage status years before it happened.57 However, the Sage of Six Paths believed Kakashi's greatest strength is as a teacher, leader, and friend, all of which proved vital in Kaguya ≈åtsutsuki's defeat.58 Even after losing his Sharingan, Kakashi's combat prowess continued to increase.56",
        "Kakashi engages Kakuzu in hand-to-hand combat.",
        "Originally, by his own admission, Kakashi's chakra reserves were average. He could only use the Lightning Cutter four or Kamui three times per day. To compensate, he makes up for it with superb control, requiring no more than the minimum required amount to perform his technique, even able to do so with a single hand. However, by Part II, Kakashi's reserves increased to a considerable size, able to both techniques several more times and repeatedly in a single battle with only minor exhaustion. In later years, his reserves increased further, letting him create and maintain four collective massive walls for a few days and casually utilise his Purple Electricity numerous times.",
        "Kakashi's taijutsu can take various approaches in close combat. His time in the Anbu enables him to suddenly approach enemies from behind, unnoticed by even other Anbu.59 Likewise, he can attack from the front, striking with blazing speed and debilitating precision to quickly defeat multiple enemies. Kakashi is able to open at least one of the Eight Gates.60 He has reflexes sharp enough to block attacks he is unable to see,61 and has immense speed that allows him to perform hand seals at unreadable rates.55",
        "Kakashi using Rasengan.",
        'In battle, Kakashi primarily relies on his great skill and knowledge of ninjutsu. As an Academy Student, he excelled past his peers in ninjutsu, being able to use the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique.62 Over the years, due in large part to his Sharingan, he gained a vast arsenal; reputed to have copied over a thousand techniques, which led to his moniker as "Copy Ninja Kakashi" („Ç≥„Éî„ÉºÂøçËÄÖ„ÅÆ„Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, Kopƒ´ Ninja no Kakashi).63 This, combined with years of experience, Kakashi can handle almost any situation in various ways.

From his background in the Anbu, Kakashi's swordsmanship became very adaptable, able to effectively utilise the Kubikirib≈çch≈ç,67 a uniquely shaped blade with noticeable size and weight, and able to defeat kenjutsu experts such as the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist.68 He also has considerable skill in shurikenjutsu, being able to lash out at an opponent with a swift flurry of kunai and even effectively throw kunai with a well-placed kick.69 Likewise in close range battles, he can skillfully use use weapons in both hands simultaneously and even fend off other skilled melee combatants such as Zabuza and Hidan, armed with their respective unique weapons, using a single kunai.",

With Earth Release, he can move underground for sneak attacks or produce multiple intricate walls to defend himself or large areas from attack.71 Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi learned to convert his Earth Release techniques into quartz. Improving the quality of his techniques in this way negates its weakness to lightning-based nature attacks by absorbing and dissipating opposing techniques.56 He is shown using Fire Release to launch a massive fireball.72",

Other lightning techniques include creating hounds to attack with, clones that paralyse opponents on contact,78 and cords that can even cut through the highly dense Tailed Beast Chakra Arms. By his tenure as the Sixth Hokage, he created a new signature technique; the Lightning Release: Purple Electricity, which allows him to release a surge of purple lightning to produce a variety of effects: attack from afar, augment his physical strikes, and release a burst from all around him.',
        "Kakashi's Sharingan.",
        "Kakashi received his Sharingan during the Third Shinobi World War from Obito Uchiha, a replacement for the left eye he'd lost shortly beforehand. The Sharingan became his most identifying feature in the years since then, such that he is widely known as \"Kakashi of the Sharingan\" (ÂÜôËº™Áúº„ÅÆ„Ç´„Ç´„Ç∑, Sharingan no Kakashi). With this d≈çjutsu, Kakashi can accurately reproduce any movement he sees (his own physical skill permitting), take in a heightened amount of visual information, and perform the Sharingan's broad category of genjutsu. Because he isn't an Uchiha, he can't deactivate the Sharingan and it rapidly drains his chakra whenever he uses it, leaving him bedridden after extended use.79 As such, he always keeps the eye covered until he needs it. Due to these challenges, Kakashi hasn't mastered every aspect of the Sharingan,8081 Despite his handicap, he is still noted to have impressive prowess wielding it, as noted by both Itachi and Obito Uchiha.8283 Kakashi lost his Sharingan during the Fourth Shinobi World War.84 When Obito died with both his Sharingan, his spirit briefly returned from the afterlife and inhabited Kakashi's body. During which, Obito channelled both his eyes' d≈çjutsu power into Kakashi, granting full usage of their abilities with no strains or setbacks. The loss of his Sharingan during the war resulted in him no longer using his Lightning Cutter safely, as the tunnel vision was no longer countered by the Sharingan.",
        "Kakashi's Mangeky≈ç Sharingan.",
        "Kakashi gained a Mangeky≈ç Sharingan when Rin Nohara died,24 which he could use after long hours of study and training.19 Its design appears as three triangles wrapping themselves around the pupil, similar to a pinwheel. He was able to maintain it for over a decade, though he was steadily suffering its side-effects with each usage, such as bleeding eyes and deteriorating vision. With his left Mangeky≈ç, Kakashi can use the long-range variant of Kamui: remotely forming a barrier around whatever he looks at to warp the target to Kamui's dimension; eventually, he learns how to send himself to the dimension and to a new location from it.85 While initially had trouble to aim Kamui properly.86 he improved to the point that he can accurately use Kamui on fast-moving projectiles.87 Originally, it requires some amount of preparation and has a huge drain on chakra each time it is performed, but later could perform to fast for most people to even most, and use it repeatedly it with much lower drain of chakra.88",
        "Kakashi's Complete Body ‚Äî Susanoo.",
        "After Kakashi loses his Sharingan, his body is temporarily inhabited by Obito's spirit, allowing him to use both of Obito's Mangeky≈ç. Due to these eyes possessing Six Paths Chakra, this allowed Kakashi to utilize the Mangeky≈ç Sharingan and its abilities with much greater power, as well as repeated and extended use of them with no ill effects to his health, chakra, or eyesight.89 In addition to the long-range Kamui he'd originally had, he could use its short-range variant to overlap his body with Kamui's dimension, effectively making him intangible so that any dangers phase through him.90 By combining this ability with his Lightning Cutter, Kakashi can bypass all defences and eliminate the possibility of being countered while attacking. Having manifested a dual Mangeky≈ç, Kakashi can use Susanoo, which he honed into its \"Complete Body\" form. It can be used for flight, defend others with its large size, and even have the intangibility of Kamui extended to it. It can manifest either swords or shuriken to aid him in battle, the latter of which can produce Kamui Shuriken in order to warp away whatever they cut. Kakashi lost all these abilities after Obito's spirit returned to the afterlife.",
        "Part of Kakashi's usual approach to combat is to rely on the Body Replacement Technique and clone techniques, thereby keeping himself out of harm's way while he observes an opponent and their abilities.91 Even when he doesn't use this system of misdirection and decoys, he remains alert to any unexplained or unexpected occurrences, coming up with theories for their causes when they arise and exploiting them if they prove true, which they usually do.92 Once he identifies an opponent's weakness, Kakashi can quickly formulate a plan to take advantage of it, efficiently utilising each of his allies' unique skills to that purpose. Such plans, while often elaborate and unorthodox, are typically highly successful and very low-risk, making Kakashi invaluable as a leader. He has also proven himself a very talented teacher, able to push his students' development by months, if not years, in just weeks through various innovative methods.",

During his first meeting with Team 7, Kakashi is unimpressed by them, finding them all to be too self-interested. He nevertheless gives them a bell test as he has for all the previous teams he's been assigned to and tells them to take one of the two bells on his person. Naruto launches a first attack before the test officially begins; Kakashi stops him easily, but is nevertheless amused.",
        "Kakashi reads Icha Icha Paradise during the test, convinced he won't need his full attention or both of his hands. Naruto and his shadow clones fail to take a bell and Sakura, who focuses on looking for Sasuke, is defeated by one of Kakashi's genjutsu. Kakashi then goes to find Sasuke, expecting the same outcome as Naruto and Sakura, but finds Sasuke was waiting for him. Kakashi is forced to go on the defence and, when Sasuke uses the Great Fireball Technique, he must close his copy of Icha Icha, but he still manages to defeat Sasuke. Kakashi gathers them together afterwards and tells them they've failed, explaining that, had they worked together rather than individually, they might have succeeded in acquiring a bell. They convince him to give them another chance after lunch, but Kakashi demands that Naruto not be fed. He secretly watches them as they eat and sees Sasuke and Sakura give Naruto food against his instructions, needing Naruto in top form if they're to get a bell. Kakashi pretends anger when he approaches them, but tells them that they pass the test for placing the team's well-being above the mission parameters.",

He complains to the Third Hokage about this and is able to secure a C-rank mission: escorting Tazuna to the Land of Waves. Shortly after leaving Konoha, Kakashi notices they're being pursued by the Demon Brothers. He pretends to be killed by one of the Demon Brothers' attacks so that he can observe them, stepping in to neutralise them once Team 7 can't hold them off anymore. After restraining them, Kakashi confronts Tazuna on why the Demon Brothers were trying to kill him. Tazuna confesses that assassins have been hired to kill him so that he can't build a bridge that will free the Land of Waves from the tyranny of Gat≈ç. Although this is an A-rank assignment that Team 7, being only genin, are unqualified for, they decide to help Tazuna anyway because Tazuna confessed his country is too poor to afford an A-rank assignment.",

Recognising how formidable Zabuza is, Kakashi uncovers his Sharingan and engages him, leaving his students in charge of protecting Tazuna. Kakashi initially does well against Zabuza, defeating Zabuza's water clones with his own. When Zabuza succeeds in trapping him in a Water Prison, Kakashi instructs Team 7 to leave him behind and escape with Tazuna. Naruto ignores him and with help from Sasuke is able to release him. Kakashi thanks them and resumes his fight with Zabuza, copying his ninjutsu and using them against him. Just as he is about to finish off Zabuza, Zabuza is seemingly killed by a young hunter-nin and his body is taken away. Team 7 continues on to Tazuna's home, but Kakashi must be carried, having exhausted himself due to overuse of the Sharingan.",
        "While recuperating, Kakashi starts to find Zabuza's death suspicious and worries he may still be alive. In case this is true, he shows Team 7 the Tree Climbing Practice in order to improve their chakra control, which will be useful if Zabuza does indeed return. After a week of rest Kakashi has recovered and all of Team 7 has mastered the exercise; Naruto is tired from the training and is allowed to keep sleeping as they resume their bodyguarding of Tazuna. When they arrive at the bridge Tazuna is working on, they find Zabuza and Haku (the hunter-nin from before) waiting for them. Haku traps Sasuke in his Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals, which Zabuza blocks Kakashi from helping him escape from. Once Naruto arrives to lend Sasuke assistance, Kakashi engages Zabuza in combat.",

Because of this, Kakashi sticks close to Tazuna, knowing Zabuza will come for him eventually. Zabuza does indeed attack, and Kakashi is badly injured by Zabuza's Kubikirib≈çch≈ç while defending Tazuna. While reeling from his wound, Kakashi senses Naruto using the Nine-Tails' chakra. Fearing that the seal containing the beast is weakening, Kakashi decides to finish the battle quickly: he summons his ninken and has them track down his blood which is still on Zabuza's Kubikirib≈çch≈ç. Once they locate him, they pin him down while Kakashi attacks with his Lightning Cutter. Just before he hits Zabuza, Haku steps in front of him and takes the attack instead.",

Gat≈ç then arrives to kill them all, Zabuza included, with a horde of mercenaries. Zabuza kills Gat≈ç first and Kakashi scares off the horde with his \"Multiple Shadow Clone Technique\" (which is implied to just be the normal Clone Technique).

There, he is informed that Sasuke was attacked by Orochimaru during the exams and branded with a Cursed Seal of Heaven. Kakashi warns Sasuke that he will be disqualified if he uses the cursed seal during his match. Sasuke avoids doing so and Kakashi takes him away afterwards, applying the Evil Sealing Method to prevent the cursed seal's use. After Sasuke passes out from the procedure, Orochimaru confronts Kakashi, explaining his plans to acquire Sasuke's Sharingan for himself. Kakashi readies his Lightning Cutter to defend Sasuke, but Orochimaru decides to leave, confident Sasuke will come to him willingly someday; Kakashi afterwards realises he would have been killed had they fought. Kakashi takes Sasuke to the hospital to rest, places him under the guard of Anbu, and returns to watch the remaining preliminary matches, having promised Sasuke that he'd tell him all about the other combatants' abilities.",

He also helps him improve his physical speed by visualising and mimicking Rock Lee's movements. Training runs long and they end up arriving late for Sasuke's match against Gaara of Sunagakure.

Realising that this is a good opportunity to try once again to reunite with Sasuke, Kakashi combines Teams 7 and 8 into an Eight Man Squad with the mission to find either Sasuke or his assumed target, Itachi. They split up to look for leads on either Uchiha, with Kakashi providing one or more of his ninken to those without any particular tracking ability. None find anything until witnessing C0; they converge at its epicentre and can detect Sasuke's trail.",

They make repeated attempts to kill or capture him, but every attack passes through him without sign of damage. Zetsu eventually appears and reports to Tobi that Itachi has died in battle with Sasuke. No longer needing to distract the Eight Man Squad, Tobi disappears; before he goes, Kakashi notices that he has a Sharingan, which deeply troubles him. Kakashi scouts the area and notices Itachi's Amaterasu in the distance. They rush there, hoping to reach Sasuke before Tobi does, but they are too late and cannot rediscover his trail.",

He is present when this news is shared with Naruto, who was too distraught to be of assistance and needed some time alone. Before he died, Jiraiya sent a number of things to Konoha that would help them against Pain, including an encrypted message. Shikamaru is able to properly console and get Naruto to help him decode it, who realises that the key to its decryption must be Icha Icha Tactics. Kakashi, having the only copy, is asked to read specific passages aloud, which makes him extremely uncomfortable. Nevertheless, the message is deciphered.",

Kakashi guesses this tactic and goes searching for one of the latter group. In doing so he finds the Deva Path, and by confronting it he is able to save Iruka Umino. Kakashi tries to corner the Deva Path so that he can destroy it with his Lightning Cutter, but it repels him with Shinra Tensei. Pain, recognising that Kakashi is a dangerous opponent, sends the Asura Path to help the Deva Path. Kakashi struggles against both due to the shared vision of their Rinnegan, but their clashing jutsu at least attracts reinforcements' attention: Ch≈çza and Ch≈çji Akimichi cripple the Asura Path when they arrive.",
        "Kakashi defeated by Pain.",
        "From careful observation of the Deva Path's abilities, Kakashi notices a brief cool down period between its jutsu. To take advantage of this, Kakashi plants chains under it and has Ch≈çza and Ch≈çji attack it from opposite sides. When they are deflected by Shinra Tensei, they grab the chains and restrain him, giving Kakashi an opportunity to attack with his Lightning Cutter. Before he can land the blow, the Asura Path uses itself as a shield, giving the Deva Path time to counter. It defeats all of Kakashi's reinforcements and binds Kakashi in rubble. Anticipating that Kakashi will interfere if allowed to live, the Deva Path propels a nail at his head to kill him and leaves. Kakashi, however, only pretends death, warping away the nail at the last moment with Kamui. When Ch≈çji wakes up, Kakashi sends him to Tsunade to tell her everything they've learned about the Deva Path's abilities. The still-functioning Asura Path fires a missile at Ch≈çji in an attempt to stop him, forcing Kakashi to use Kamui again to warp away the missile. This depletes his chakra reserves and causes his death.",

He concludes his story by saying that he understands the choices Sakumo made when he was alive and that he is proud to be his son. Just then, a light envelops Kakashi, a sign of his revival; before Kakashi returns to the living plane, Sakumo thanks him for putting him at peace at long last, allowing him to continue to the afterlife. Kakashi wakes up, surprising those nearby. He is informed of what happened while he was dead, such as that Pain destroyed the village and that Naruto, upon returning, defeated Pain. As Naruto returns to Konoha, Kakashi goes to meet him and carries him back, where his victory is celebrated by all the villagers.",

The Raikage permits it, but even with his and Yamato's support, he refuses Naruto's request to forgive Sasuke's recent work with Akatsuki and leaves them. They stay at an inn nearby while deciding what to do, where Naruto is confronted by Tobi. Having expected him, Kakashi and Yamato attack and restrain him, though he points out that he can escape whenever he wants. Rather than do that, he tells them about Sasuke's motivations: to take vengeance on Konoha for forcing Itachi to kill the Uchiha clan. They doubt what he says regarding the Uchiha Clan Downfall, but Tobi is unconcerned, leaving once he's finished saying to Naruto what he wanted to. Afterwards, Kakashi encourages that three of them keep what Tobi said between them until they knew more and if what Tobi said was true.",
        "Naruto decides that the only course of action left is to speak with Sasuke himself. His attempt to locate Sasuke is interrupted by the arrival of Sai and Sakura, the latter of whom tells Naruto she loves him. Kakashi doubts this is the real reason for coming all the way to the Land of Iron, which one of Sai's ink clones confirms after Sakura and her entourage leave: the rest of the Konoha 11 have decided that it's their responsibility, as Sasuke's former friends, to kill him before he sparks a war, a burden Sakura has taken for herself. Before they can go after her, they are met by Gaara and his bodyguards, who tell them about Sasuke's attack on the summit and Tobi's declaration of the Fourth Shinobi World War. Gaara also shares the Five Kage's requests that Kakashi represent Konoha going forward owing to Danz≈ç's behaviour during the Kage Summit. Naruto is overwhelmed by all the developments going on and passes out.",

The clone dissolves along the way, which it explains to be because Sakura knocked out the original Sai. Kakashi catches up with her in time to stop Sasuke from killing her with Chidori. Kakashi tells Sakura that she doesn't need to take responsibility for Sasuke since he, as Sasuke's former teacher, is much more to blame for the team's growing rift and current dire situation. He asks Sasuke once more to let go of his thirst for vengeance, but Sasuke laughs in his face, having been too corrupted by Tobi to be reasoned with any longer. As he prepares for battle, Kakashi remarks that he finally understands what the Third Hokage went through with Orochimaru. Sasuke uses his Susanoo to fire an arrow at Kakashi, which he warps away with Kamui. Sasuke is enraged by this use of an Uchiha's ability and threatens to make Kakashi suffer. While he does so, Sakura approaches from behind to kill him, but ultimately cannot and Kakashi, tired from using Kamui, can't reach her in time to save her from Sasuke's retaliation.",

From fighting them, however, none use the any of the Six Paths Techniques, leading Kakashi to believe Tobi doesn't have the energy for it.

Kakashi asks where Tobi acquired his Sharingan, to which he replies it was on the same mission to the Kannabi Bridge that Kakashi got his own. Kakashi is troubled by what this might mean, but doesn't overlook the important fact that they now have a way of fighting Tobi.
